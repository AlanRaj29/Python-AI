#variables:

    ###Python has no command for declaring a variable.

    ###A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    
    
# x = 5
# y = "Raj"
# print(x)
# print(y)





    ###Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.


# x = 7
# x = "Raj"
# x = 8
# print(x)
